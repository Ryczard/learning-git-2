		<h1>"Right in Two"</h1>
		<h2>Tool</h2>
		<p>Angels on the sideline,<br>
			Puzzled and amused.<br>
			Why did Father give these humans free will?<br>
			Now they're all confused.
		</p>
		<p>Don't these talking monkeys know that<br>
			Eden has enough to go around?<br>
			Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys,<br>
			Where there's one you're bound to divide it.<br>
			Right in two.
