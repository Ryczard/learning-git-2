		<h1>"Right in Two"</h1>
		<h2>Tool</h2>
		<p>Angels on the sideline,<br>
			Puzzled and amused.<br>
			Why did Father give these humans free will?<br>
			Now they're all confused.
		</p>
		<p>Don't these talking monkeys know that<br>
			Eden has enough to go around?<br>
			Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys,<br>
			Where there's one you're bound to divide it.<br>
			Right in two.
		</p>
		<p>Angels on the sideline,<br>
			Baffled and confused.<br>
			Father blessed them all with reason.<br>
			And this is what they choose.<br>
			And this is what they choose...
		</p>
		<p>Monkey killing monkey killing monkey<br>
			Over pieces of the ground.<br>
			Silly monkeys give them thumbs,<br>
			They forge a blade,<br>
			And where there's one<br>
			They're bound to divide it,<br>
			Right in two.<br>
			Right in two.
		</p>
		<p>Monkey killing monkey killing monkey.<br>
			Over pieces of the ground.<br>
			Silly monkeys give them thumbs.<br>
			They make a club.<br>
			And beat their brother, down.<br>
			How they survive so misguided is a mystery.
